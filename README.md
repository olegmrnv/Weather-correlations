# Weather-correlations
In this project I generate list of cities based on random selection of latitude and longitude. Then I use API call to api.openweathermap.org to obtain weather data for those cities. When data received I create several plots to visualize it and analyze different correlations or lack of such. 

Following libraries are being used in this project: matplotlib, pandas, numpy, requests, time, citipy, datetime.
