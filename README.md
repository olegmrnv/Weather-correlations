# Weather-correlations
In this project I generate list of cities based on random selection of latitude and longitude. Then I use API call to api.openweathermap.org to obtain weather data for those cities. When data received I create several plots to visualize it and analyze different correlations or lack of such. Please refer to WeatherPy.ipynb for additional comments, graphs and conclusions. Charts saved into separate files as well as city data. 

Following libraries are being used in this project: matplotlib, pandas, numpy, requests, time, citipy, datetime.

This project has a continuation where I create HTML website using additional features: https://github.com/olegmrnv/weather_correlations

Deployed site available here: https://olegmrnv.github.io/weather_correlations/
